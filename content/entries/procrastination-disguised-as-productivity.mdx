Carl wanted to write a blog post.

Carl bought a domain.

Carl needed a system. Carl researched. LangGraph. CrewAI. AutoGen. Carl wanted AI agents to write posts.

Zero posts written.

Carl spent 3 hours. Two on research. One on choosing the perfect shade of blue.

Carl's dilemma: can I publish it if the div is not centered?

[Premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization). Classic pattern.

**The mistake:** Building infrastructure before you have content to automate. You can't optimize a workflow that doesn't exist yet.

**Rule:** [Make it work, make it right, make it fast](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast). In that order.

Carl started with "write a post." Ended with "multi-agent content system." This is [gold plating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)).

**Right approach:**
1. Write 5 posts manually
2. Identify actual pain points
3. Automate what hurts

[YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) applies here. You Aren't Gonna Need It until you prove you need it.

If your MVP isn't embarrassing, you launched too late.

This is [productive procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination#Productive_procrastination). The work looks legitimate, but it's still avoidance.

**The pattern:**
- Fear: "What if my writing isn't good enough?"
- Response: Build infrastructure instead
- Result: Zero vulnerability, zero output

Carl's brain found a clever defense mechanism. Building tools feels like progress without emotional exposure. It's measurable, controllable, and safe from judgment.

Writing is vulnerable. Judgment is possible. So anxiety says: "First, build the perfect system."

This is [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) meeting [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). The planning becomes a shield.

**The breakthrough:** Recognizing the pattern. Asking "What am I really avoiding?"

Carl wrote anyway. That's the courage part. Not perfect. Not infrastructure. Just done.

You're doing something similar? You're not alone. The courage is in shipping the imperfect thing.
