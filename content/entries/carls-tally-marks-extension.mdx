Carl wants to leave yesterday.

Carl doesn't leave today.

Carl built [Carl's Tally Marks](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/carls-tally-marks/nlbbaaameliooepffcddnmfckgoaphan) with Basil.

Carl clicks button. One mark.

Carl clicks again. Another mark.

Carl clicks 46 more times. Carl needs hobbies.

Chrome extensions = underrated learning projects.

**Why:**
- Real JavaScript
- Actual publishing (Chrome Web Store)
- Small scope (you'll actually finish)
- Real users

**What Carl learned:**
- Manifest V3 configuration
- Chrome APIs
- Publishing workflow
- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)

This beats tutorial hell. Shipping teaches more than reading.

**AI pair programming works when:**
- You know what to build
- You can validate the output
- You iterate fast

AI accelerates. Doesn't replace skill. Carl had the idea. AI handled boilerplate.

[Ship side projects](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). They compound.

Carl built this for fun. No deadline. No pressure. Just wanted to.

That's [intrinsic motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic). Building for joy, not obligation.

**Why it matters:**

When work projects feel like grind, personal projects remind you: "I actually like building things."

**AI as collaborator:** Carl wasn't alone. Basil pair programmed. Even "just AI" creates:
- Dialogue
- Feedback loops
- Momentum

That's [social scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding). You don't need to do everything solo.

Carl published it. Made it public. That takes courage.

Build something small. Ship it. Simple ideas shipped > complex ideas unshipped.
