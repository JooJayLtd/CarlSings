Carl wanted to write. Carl researched instead.

LangGraph. CrewAI. AutoGen. Carl wanted AI agents to write his posts.

Zero posts written.

Building feels safe. Technical. Measurable. Writing is scary.

Carl hid behind "the right foundation." Classic move.

New plan:
1. Write this post (done)
2. Write 4 more manually
3. **THEN** maybe build agents

Question: Solving a problem or avoiding vulnerability?

[Premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization). Classic pattern.

**The mistake:** Building infrastructure before you have content to automate. You can't optimize a workflow that doesn't exist yet.

**Rule:** [Make it work, make it right, make it fast](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast). In that order.

Carl started with "write a post." Ended with "multi-agent content system." This is [gold plating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)).

**Right approach:**
1. Write 5 posts manually
2. Identify actual pain points
3. Automate what hurts

[YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) applies here. You Aren't Gonna Need It until you prove you need it.

If your MVP isn't embarrassing, you launched too late.

This is [productive procrastination](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2010/11/procrastination). The work looks legitimate, but it's still avoidance.

**The pattern:**
- Fear: "What if my writing isn't good enough?"
- Response: Build infrastructure instead
- Result: Zero vulnerability, zero output

Carl's brain found a clever defense mechanism. Building tools feels like progress without emotional exposure. It's measurable, controllable, and safe from judgment.

Writing is vulnerable. Judgment is possible. So anxiety says: "First, build the perfect system."

This is [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) meeting [imposter syndrome](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2012/11/imposter-syndrome). The planning becomes a shield.

**The breakthrough:** Recognizing the pattern. Asking "What am I really avoiding?"

Carl wrote anyway. That's the courage part. Not perfect. Not infrastructure. Just done.

You're doing something similar? You're not alone. The courage is in shipping the imperfect thing.
